# Energy Explorer by Watt Patrol

This project is for the Hawaii Keiki Museum (HKM) Energy Usage Display for the 2024 Hawaii Hackathon. Energy Explorer is an interactive web application designed to educate Hawai'i's keiki about household energy consumption and conservation. Generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.9, this prototype provides an engaging and educational experience for the keiki as they explore energy usage in a household.

Children can toggle various household appliances—such as lights, fans, a refrigerator, TV, and air conditioner—on or off to see how much energy each one uses. As appliances are switched on, energy usage is tracked in real-time and displayed through a dynamic energy meter.

The application includes sound effects and a lightbulb friend that gives out helpful tip and fun facts, making it fun and engaging. If too many appliances are left running simultaneously, the energy meter will show an overload, encouraging children to make smarter energy decisions. This immersive experience teaches keiki about energy efficiency, the importance of mindful consumption, and the role of renewable energy in maintaining a sustainable future.

The Energy Explorer web app is deployed at:
    https://hacc2024.github.io/Watt-Patrol/ 

For the best viewing experience, view on an iPad Pro 12.9.
